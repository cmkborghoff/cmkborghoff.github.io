Studio: Facets of Earth
Role: Concept, 3D rendering, casting cleanup
Materials: pink moissanite, 14k gold, lab-grown diamonds

For this ring, I worked closely with the client to design a ring inspired by the peony flower in nature. It went through several rounds of revions based on their feedbakc and images provided by the client.

# CAD Designs

# Casting

I worked with a casting vendor to print and cast our 3D rendering. It was returned to us in its raw state where I cleaned and polished it, and another jeweler in the studio set the stones before we delivered it to the client.
