I run an online store called [TauraMori](https://www.etsy.com/shop/TauraMori) in my free time, where I create small batch jewelry and accessories. Most of the pieces use a variety of materials and fabrication techniques, including laser cutting and engraving, leatherwork, and sewing. I design, produce, pack, and ship everything myself.

Below are some selected pieces I've made through the years. To see more, check out my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/tauramori/) or [Etsy Page](https://www.etsy.com/shop/TauraMori).

## Shoe/skate wings

One of the most popular items I produce for TauraMori are wings that can be affixed through the laces onto shoes or rollerskates. I make them based off all different species of insects I find beautiful. I use my laser cutter to acheive the complex forms, and make them with longevity and quality in mind. I put a lot of pride and care into each set I make.

## Acrylic marigold earrings

These earrings are made of glittering marbled acrylic with varying shades of orange, and etched with a gold engraving. They are posts with a large metal and plastic backing so they sit comfortably in the wearers' ear. They are an orginal design I made in Adobe Illustrator, laser-cut and assembled with gold plated steel posts, and should be safe for sensitive ears.
