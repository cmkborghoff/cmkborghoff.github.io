# CAD Design

The stones are added in Adobe Photoshop at the end of the CAD process to reflect specific stones client selected in store.

## First Draft

closely based on inspiration photos provided by client

## Second Draft

we needed to make some adjustments based off budget, and also drew some inpsiration from another piece in the store the client was admiring

# Finished Product

CAD design was sent to casting vendor who used it to create a mold and cast the piece. I cleaned up the raw casting and another jeweler set the stones before we delivered the finished ring to the client.
