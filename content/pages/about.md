I'm a jewelry & accessories designer with over seven years of experience in producing jewlery and more utilziing digital fabrication methods and more traditional practices on the bench. I started out earning my BFA in Metals form SUNY New Paltz. I have worked at a variety of organizations throughout my career, starting out at large scale brands including [Jared](https://www.jared.com/) and [Baublebar](https://www.baublebar.com/).

In 2019 I relocated to the Hudson Valley, where I joined the team at [Facets of Earth](https://facetsofearth.com/), an open studio style workshop specializing in custom fine jewelry. After a few years here, I additionally joined the team at digital fabrication studio [Nervous System](https://n-e-r-v-o-u-s.com/index.php).

In my free time, I run my Etsy Shop, [TauraMori](https://www.etsy.com/shop/TauraMori) where I craft and sell custom jewelry and accessories.
